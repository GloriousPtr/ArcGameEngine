## About

Arc Engine is an in-development game engine written in C++.

I develop it in my spare time as a personal project, so expect frequent periods of time with no activity in this repository.

## Set up

You can clone Arc Game Engine using git. Make sure you do a ```--recursive``` clone!

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MohitSethi99/ArcEngine.git
```

Arc Game Engine is built in a Windows environment, using Visual Studio 2022.

Execute the script `scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat`
to generate the solution and project files.

## Current Features

Right now, Arc Game Engine is very bare-bones. Its most remarkable features are:
